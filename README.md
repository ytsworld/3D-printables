# 3D printables

This repo contains a collection of 3D printable designs I have created so far.
For printing I'm using an FMD printer Prusa i3 MK3s+.

The designs are stored using '.FCStd' files, created with [FreeCad 0.19](https://www.freecadweb.org/) (and 0.20).

- [car](./car) contains designs for our Micro Camper
- [pool](./pool) contains addons for a Intex steel frame pool
- [3d_printer](./3d_printer) contains parts for my 3D printer
- [misc](./misc) contains random stuff that I thought that they could be useful
