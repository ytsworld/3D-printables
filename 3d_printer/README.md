# Parts for 3D printing

## Filament testing body

A sample print that contains some challenges for printer and the used material.
Contains overhangs, objects close together (stringing) and preparations for drilling holes and pins for metrics screws & nuts of different sizes.

## Angle piece for "Ikea lack" printer enclosure

This is a small extension for the awesome printer enclosure using Ikea lack tables and
printed parts from [this design](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3085211).
As one of the tables act as a base and it's a bit unsteady when the printer is working hard,
I added an angle piece to increase rigidity of the base.

## Connector for Homematic IP temperature and humidity sensor

As for some prints the environment temperature matters, I thought its a good idea to add a temperature sensor
inside the enclosure.
