# Miscellaneous

An unsorted mix of designs that came in my mind.

## Eye's for plushies

Eye's that can be used for self knitted plushies. The eye size and other parameters can easily modified by editing the file in FreeCad and editing the parameters sheet.

[Eye pin](./eye_with_pin.stl)

[Clip](./eye_clipper.stl)

## Magnet buffer for mosquito net

A simple print with a cutout for a 20 x 6 x 1.5 mm magnet.

[Buffer](./mosquito_fence_magnetic_buffer.stl)

Printed with rubber (Filatech Filaflex 40) and 0.1mm layer height to reduce noise level when mosquito door is pushed against the main door.
To place the magnet into the print, add a pause at 2.3mm height.

## Saucer

A simple custom saucer for plants adding some extra height.
Printed with PETG 0.3mm as two separate parts and glued together.
